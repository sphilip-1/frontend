About Us
</h9>

<br></br>
	<br></br>

<h10>
We are a small and diverse team of students and we all have a passion for specific aspects of software development, and we believe we can and will bring a lot to the table when it comes to software projects, regardless of the topic at hand.

We believe that our unique perspective will allow us to solve problems in a more creative way, compared to conventional methods of teaching and make education available to users in different parts of the globe from different backgrounds.
</h10>


<br></br>

	<h12>
We started this project at the beginning of October to achieve a goal that we considered to be one of the most important SDG, that is to provide  quality education for all.
</h12>
	
	<br></br>
<h14>
We have created this website to provide basic education for those who cannot have access to it due to various factors in their lives such as gender inequality, lack of schools and unavailability of trained teachers . Through this app we are trying to provide free education through the resources provided by our team in forms of pdfâ€™s and PowerPoint which can  be accessed by anyone around the world by just registering themselves.
</h14>
	<br></br>

<h16>
We have created this app so that the people who are accessing it can have knowledge of subjects such as  mathematics and science, so that they can have better jobs and apply these knowledge in the development of countries or can be a medium for them  to achieve further education
